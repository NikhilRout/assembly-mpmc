Compilation of Assembly programs for the 8051 microcontroller

## The 8051

### Lab Experiments
Week 1: Arithmetic Operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)\
Week 2: Exchanging Data between an array of registers & Finding Largest Number in an array of registers\
Week 3: Blinking an LED through 8051 port gpios\
Week 4: Square Wave Generation (10ms) and Using a timer as a counter

### Random Practice
* Largest number in an array of registers
* Smallest number in an array of registers
* Sorting an array of registers into ascending order
* Sorting an array of registers into descending order
* Celcius -> fahrenhiet conversion
* Average of an array of registers
* Sorting an array of registers into even and odd register arrays
